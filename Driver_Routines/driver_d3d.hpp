 * API for loading D3D files for the game Driver: You are the Wheelman.
 * D3D files are used to specify which palettes are used by which textures. This api can be used to safely and easily load, manipulate, and save such files.
 */

/*! \brief Contains a list of palette indicies and the texture number they correspond to.
 *
 * This describes which palettes a texture uses. This will not change which palette is used for a certain model,
 * but it allows for changing of the palette index so that new textures can be imported. This must be updated when
 * a texture gets a new palette, or the game will continue to use the previous palette index.
